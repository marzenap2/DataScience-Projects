Data Definitions:

The following real-world Uverse data gives information about the viewers of several TV shows. The information included about a particular view is gender, age, household income code, and observation status of a given TV show. A positive observation (‘1’) indicates that the particular viewer watched the given show, while a negative observation (‘0’) indicates they do not watch the show. There are six shows captured for each viewer. Each field is separated by a pipe (‘|’). The data is available here. Note: Click the download file icon at top right. The preview feature doesn't work but it will download - takes some time due to file size.

Gender Code
Valid Gender Codes:
1-3 where
        1 = Male
        2 = Female
        3 = Unknown

All other values in gender code should be cleaned up by either removing them or adding them to Unknown

Income Level Code

    0-9, A-D
Invalid Income Level Codes:
    NA

TV Shows
Valid values:

Questions
    How many viewers have the income code 4?
    How many females are in the population?
    What is the median age?
    What is the mode of the income level code?
    How many viewers are under the age of 18?

Predictive Models
Regression
    Create a linear model to showing the relationship between a viewer’s age and the total number of TV shows watched.

Classification / Clustering
    Create a cluster about each show (might be best to do a subset for each TV show) to show which age/age range is most likely to watch that show.
    Create a cluster showing which gender code is more likely to have a certain income level. Hint: you can take a similar approach to question 1 for the graphs or you can find a way to put all income codes in 1 graph.
